It would be wonderful if we have nodejs wrappers/modules around R models.

There are too many R based models out there in the world, but atleast a few of them would be good for nodejs environment.

This project aims to provide these R models to nodejs developers:

Available Models:
 Dimensionality Reduction
 * Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
 * Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE)
 
 Regression:
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  
  Many more to be supported in future.
  Let me know your feedback if other features would be more helpful.
